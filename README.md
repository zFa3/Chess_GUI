zFa3 - Chess GUI

This project is made in Python and Tkinter
Chess Programming Wiki (Chessprogramming.org)
was very helpful

Apologize for the messy code, still learning

Im not certain the framework covers all the
edge cases of chess but its close, however
the perft test is slightly bugged, so some postions
may report missing moves at a higher depth
